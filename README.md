This code is based on the [Sample4Geo](https://github.com/Skyy93/Sample4Geo) framework. 

**Details of the datasets, training and inference can be found in Sample4Geo.**



### Dataset Preparation

To accelerate training/test time, you can run `data_preparation.py`ï¼Œ which  implements  image transformation (from '.jpg'/'.png' to '.pt') and cropping (similar to  [SAFA](https://github.com/shiyujiao/cross_view_localization_SAFA)). 

When you process images from '.jpg'/'.png' to '.pt', you should set `ext='pt'` in `sample4geo/dataset/*.py`

Also, if you are experiencing network errors about the backbone, you may need to download the backbone weights offline and put them into the `pretrained` folder.

### Results

We provide our pretrained results: [MFRGN-pretained.zip](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LMYpQVHeV99u4u28jtlrjw) [BaiduYun, Password: 1234], which contains pretrained weight files or files necessary to train certain network configurations (e.g. distance_dict, convnext backbone weights).
